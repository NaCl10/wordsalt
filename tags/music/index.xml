      <description>Twenty One Pilots has a song called &amp;ldquo;Neon Gravestones.&amp;quot;1 It does link into their DEMA alternate reality game, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what this article is about. This article is about the underlying commentary the song makes about how our society demonizes old age and glorifies suicide.
The core argument and premise of the song has been interpreted to concern primarily the way that society glorifies suicide, especially through celebrities, but this article will limit its scope to the parts that concern society&amp;rsquo;s demonization of old age.</description>
