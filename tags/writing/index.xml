      <description>Bernie Sanders recently posted a tweet. It read:
 When we talk about income and wealth inequality in America today, this is what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.
Right now, the two wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom 40%. Got that? TWO PEOPLE own more wealth than 40% of our people.
Is that remotely acceptable to you?
