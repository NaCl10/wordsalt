      <description>Bernie Sanders recently posted a tweet. It read:
 When we talk about income and wealth inequality in America today, this is what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.
Right now, the two wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom 40%. Got that? TWO PEOPLE own more wealth than 40% of our people.
Is that remotely acceptable to you?

      <description>The motto of this blog is &amp;ldquo;Fuck the system.&amp;rdquo; Why? Because, frankly, I&amp;rsquo;m an extremely cynical person. Then again, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in a world that&amp;rsquo;s burning around them? In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain most of the issues I have with the world as a whole, why we live in a predystopian society, and why we will soon witness systemic collapse.
1. Education ðŸ”—If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my about page, you know how big of an issue this is for me.</description>
