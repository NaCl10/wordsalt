# Hi. 

My name is Andrewâ€”that's a pen name. I'm a current high school student, a writer, a musician, and a cyclist. I also like to mess around with computers and programming on occasion.

I'm in a unique position regarding school, and that'll be one of the main topics of this blog. I went to public school for kindergarten, but for a number of reasons which I'll talk about in a later article, my mom decided to pull me out of public school. Then, for first and second grade, I went to a private Christian Montessori every Monday, while being homeschooled for the rest of the week. It did recently come out that said Christian Montessori was run by a pedophile, but that wasn't why I stopped going. I had severe anxiety as well as panic disorder as a child (which I still have, just not nearly as bad), and neither public school nor the Christian Montessori were able to properly support me. After that, I was completely, 100% homeschooled from third through eighth grade, taught by my mom, who is a licensed teacher. I'll also talk a fair bit more about her in a later article.
