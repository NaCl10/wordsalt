The United States Supreme Court just voted to reverse the 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade (and the subsequent 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey) which constitutionally protected a person's right to an abortion in the United States.[^1] 

I vehemently disagree with the court's decision for many, many reasons. For one, decades of legal scholarship and precedent have upheld the ruling in Roe. I'm no lawyer, but I think this is pretty apparent in the decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where the Supreme Court itself reevaluated Roe and *chose to uphold Roe's central holding.*[^2] It is absurd to completely discard decades of legal precedent as if it were nothing in the way the court has. Second, overturning Roe will only lead to harm done to the American people. Minority women are more likely to have abortions than white women, and will therefore face the most harm;[^3] abortion bans could collaterally damage those in need of other care, such as women who miscarry or couples seeking fertility treatments;[^4] many of the states with the toughest abortion laws also have the worst safety nets for those raising children, especially for the poor—and children born to women who were denied an abortion are more likely to live in a household where there isn't enough money for basic living expenses.[^5] Third—and most importantly—this is an assault on the bodily, medical, and religious freedom and autonomy of people across the United States. There is zero legal backing for the court's decision (as shown in Planned Parenthood v. Casey). Therefore, the only possible reason for the court's decision is that it is a move by the conservative justices of the court to enforce their conservative, Fundamentalist Christian worldview upon the people of the United States.[^6] It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell that that's fucking ridiculous. It goes completely against the founding American principles of freedom of religion and basic autonomy.

However, an angle I haven't seen many take concerns the ridiculous assault on democracy that this decision is.
