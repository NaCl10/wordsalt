The United States Supreme Court just voted to reverse the 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade (and the subsequent 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey) which constitutionally protected a person's right to an abortion in the United States.[^1] Make no mistake, I vehemently disagree with the court's decision for many, many reasons. For one, decades of legal scholarship and precedent have upheld the ruling in Roe. I'm no lawyer, but I think this is pretty apparent in the decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where the Supreme Court itself reevaluated Roe and *chose to uphold Roe's central holding.*[^2] It is absurd to complete discard decades of legal precedent as if it were nothing in the way the court has. Second, overturning Roe will only lead to harm done to the American people. Minority women are more likely to have abortions than white women, and will therefore face the most harm;[^3] abortion bans could collaterally damage those in need of other care, such as women who miscarry or couples seeking fertility treatments;[^4] many of the states with the toughest abortion laws also have the worst safety nets for those raising children, especially for the poor—and children born to women who were denied an abortion are more likely to live in a household where there isn't enough money for basic living expenses.[^5]
