The motto of this blog is "Fuck the system." Why? Because, frankly, I'm an extremely cynical person. Then again, who wouldn't be in a world that's burning around them? In this article, I'll explain most of the issues I have with the world as a whole, why we live in a predystopian society, and why we will soon witness systemic collapse.

## 1. Education

If you've read my about page, you know how big of an issue this is for me. We are at a place now where we are using a system of education that was designed in the industrial revolution that has changed *remarkably* little compared to how much the rest of the world has changed since the industrial revolution. This is a system that takes in the beautiful, wonderful, bright, curious, creative individuals that children are, and crushes all creativity and uniqueness out of them.[^1]

**On top of all that, no one is doing anything about it.**

While we are seeing slow improvement, all politicians ever talk about in education is budgeting and funding. While there are severe issues with funding in education, there is also an issue of methodology. To reiterate: the current system does not allow children to explore their natural curiousities, instead choosing to force them into a one-size-fits-mold that simply **does not work**.[^1]

## 2. Basic Human Fucking Rights

**The "inalienable" rights of queer people across the United States *somehow* remain uncertain**. 

### The Equality Act

The Equality Act is a bill proposed by the House of Representatives in 2017. It would extend the 1964 Civil Rights Act's protections to the LGBTQ+ community.[^2] However, even with the most progressive congress and administration we've seen since the bill's introduction, it *still* has not passed.[^3] This means that, in some situations, **members of the LGBTQ+ community do not have the basic rights laid out by the Civil Rights Act**. This *cannot* be allowed to remain this way.

### The Gay/Trans Panic Defense

The Gay/Trans Panic Defense is a legal defense that remains accepted in most states where a defendent can claim that a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity caused them to become violent towards the person, through means of insanity, provocation, or self-defence.[^4] **This can and has meant that people have gotten away with fucking *murder* because they "panicked" because someone was queer**. While it has been banned in a few states and would be banned at the federal level by the Equality Act,[^4] the fact that it remains legal in any sense is *inexecusable*.

## 3. MORE Basic Human Fucking Rights!

**People of color across the United States regularly face extreme racism *to this day***.

### Systemic Racism

As an overarching theme to all of this, systemic racism remains omnipresent in the United States. Systemic racism is "policies and practices that exist throughout a whole society or organization, and that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race."[^5] Many of the policies present in the United States are systemically racist. For example:
