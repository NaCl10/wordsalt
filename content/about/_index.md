# Hi. 

My name is Andrew—that's a pen name. I'm a [current high school student](#school), a [writer](#writing), a [musician](#music), and a cyclist. I also like to mess around with computers and programming on occasion.

## School
I'm in a unique position regarding school, and that'll be one of the main topics of this blog. I went to public school for kindergarten, but for a number of reasons which I'll talk about in a later article, my mom decided to pull me out of public school. Then, for first and second grade, I went to a private Christian Montessori every Monday, while being homeschooled for the rest of the week. It did recently come out that said Christian Montessori was run by a pedophile, but that wasn't why I stopped going. I had severe anxiety as well as panic disorder as a child (which I still have, just not as bad), and neither public school nor the Christian Montessori were able to properly support me. After that, I was completely, 100% homeschooled from third through eighth grade, taught by my mom, who is a licensed teacher. I'll also talk a fair bit more about her in a later article.

## Writing

I'm a reader. I always have been. After I spent years of my early life reading, this morphed into my desire to write. One of the wonderful things I've discovered about writing are the vast number of different kinds of writing. This means that, like reading, it's the kind of activity where even if you think you don't like it, you likely just haven't found the right style for you yet.

Personally, I've recently taken to academic and argumentative writing, which is one of the main reasons I started this blog: to practice argumentative writing. I've tried plenty of other forms, and while I've enjoyed many if not most of them, argumentative writing has been my favorite—at least as of late.
